        <p class="lead">Revamping the Digital Experience to Fight Hunger</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>Meet Shirley, a dedicated member of the Kids Against Hunger Canada team. Through collaboration with stakeholders, we focused on enhancing the donation process, offering diverse giving options, ensuring logo cohesiveness with global chapters, and emphasizing the importance of the mission statement.</p>
    <p>Our research journey involved understanding the donation process, recognizing the significance of diverse giving options, maintaining logo cohesiveness with global chapters, and emphasizing the core mission statement.</p>
    <p>Key considerations included the donation process, diverse giving options, logo cohesiveness, and mission statement representation, with valuable insights gained through collaboration with stakeholders.</p>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Child hunger is a pervasive issue too extensive for a single entity or country to address. Kids Against Hunger Canada is on a mission to involve Canadians, particularly the youth, in the battle against hunger and malnutrition.</p>
        <p>However, a significant challenge emerged - the organization's website lacked the necessary trustworthiness for potential donors. Outdated design and an overwhelming amount of information made donors skeptical. The key question: How can we boost contributions by enhancing transparency in the donation process and showcasing the charity's reputation and impact?</p>

<section id="iteration" class="container">
    <h2>Iteration</h2>
    <p>To address the challenges, we embarked on a journey involving wireframing, refining and testing, analyzing key findings, A/B testing, and creating a seamless user experience. The process included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Revamping the logo for better visibility</li>
        <li>Enhancing navigation for improved user experience</li>
        <li>Implementing a compelling landing page with a live meal counter</li>
        <li>Highlighting financial transparency and spending through infographics</li>
        <li>Streamlining the donation process into a concise 2-step form</li>
    </ul>
